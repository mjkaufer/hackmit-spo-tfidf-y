# HackMIT Spo-tfidf-y

Helper code for HackMIT tech talk!

## Setup

Make sure you have a working version of Python 3 on your local machine

Create a Spotify app by following the instructions [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/#register-your-app)

Install the relevant dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Run the following commands, setting your variables appropriately

```
export SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI='https://google.com'
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=''
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=''
```

Then open the jupyter notebook with `jupyter notebook` (from the same terminal window!) and open `tfidf.ipynb`
